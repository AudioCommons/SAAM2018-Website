#### Description
Music provides a fascinating and challenging field for the application of Semantic Web technologies. Music is culture.

Yet as knowledge, music takes fundamentally different forms: as digital audio waveforms recording a performance (e.g. MP3); symbolic notation prescribing a work (scores, Music Encoding Initiative); instructions for synthesising or manipulating sounds (MIDI, Digital Audio Workstations); catalogues of performance or thematic aggregations (playlists, setlists); psychological responses to listening; and as an experienced and interpretable artform.

How can these heterogeneous structures be linked to each other? To what end? How do we study these materials? Can computational and knowledge management analyses yield insight within and across musics? Semantic Web technologies have been applied to these challenges across industry, memory institutions and academia, but with results reported to conferences representing the communities of different disciplines of musical study.

SAAM is a venue for implementers of technical solutions underpinning these achievements to join in dissemination and discussion, identifying intersections in the challenges and solutions which cut across musical areas. In finding common approaches and coordination, SAAM will set the research agenda for advancing the development of semantic applications for audio and music. SAAM also invites the wider ISWC community to discover “what makes music interesting!”.
